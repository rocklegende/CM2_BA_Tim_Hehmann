\section{Background}

The following features were required for the floorplan:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Interaction}:
	The floorplan should be an interactive map. This means that the user is able to interact with the map by zooming, panning and clicking. This includes the possibility to set markers at a specific location on the map, which then can be linked with gates. A click on a marker then shows information about that specific gate.
	\item \textbf{Real-time Data Visualization}:
	Events at the gates should be displayed in real-time on the map. This includes information about the access, which enables to quickly view who entered at what gate at what time.
	\item \textbf{Eventlogging}:
	There needs to be an interface for the gates to send these events to. These need to be persisted as logs for later analytics.
	\item \textbf{Heatmap}:
	The plan should visualize the number of people in a room and render a "heat" on the map, thereby presenting the occupancy status of each room.
	\item \textbf{Alarm Localization}:
	The floorplan needs to visualize alarms, which is needed to locate threats on the map.
	\item \textbf{Upload Functionality}:
	Because of the fact that every user has different floorplans the upload of own floorplans must be possible.
\end{itemize}
