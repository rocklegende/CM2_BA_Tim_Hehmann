\section{Background}

The following features were required for the floorplan:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Interaction}:
	The floorplan should be an interactive map. This means that the user is able to zoom, pan and click on the floorplan. It includes the possibility to set markers at a specific location on the map, which then can be linked with gates. A click on a marker then shows information about that specific gate.
	\item \textbf{Real-time Data Visualization}:
	Events at the gates should be displayed in real-time on the map. This includes also information about the access, which enables to quickly view who entered at what gate at what time.
	\item \textbf{Eventlogging}:
	There needs to be an interface for the gates to send these events to. These need to be persisted as logs for later analytics.
	\item \textbf{Heatmap}:
	The plan should visualize the number of people in a room and render a "heat" on the map, thus presenting which room are currently high occupancy.
	\item \textbf{Alarm Location}:
	The floorplan needs to visualize alarms, which is needed to locate threats on the map.
	\item \textbf{Upload Functionality}:
	Because of the fact that every user has different floorplans the upload of own floorplans must be possible.
\end{itemize}
