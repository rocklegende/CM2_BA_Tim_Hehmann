\section{Evaluation}

In this chapter, we will evaluate our interactive floorplan by looking at how well it fulfills the requirements from the Concept chapter. The evaluation will be based on the result of several different measurements. We will explain how these measurements are set up and put the results into context. Besides that, we will also discuss the protection of data privacy in our floorplan.

\subsection{Real-time Data Visualization}

To measure how performant the real-time data visualization in our system is, we wrote a bash script that fires fake gate events to our backend at different time intervals (Listing~\ref{listing:realtimeEvaluationScript}). The script will execute 100 requests to our backend, which are running asynchronously.

\begin{lstlisting}[label={listing:realtimeEvaluationScript},caption={Bash script for creating fake gate events at intervals}]
#!/bin/bash
GATE_COUNT=10
DEVICE_ID_WHICH_ACCESSED="c8ce80bc-c238-44bf-bc8b-fe68a3dbb957"
SLEEP_TIME=0.1

createGateEventLog() {
    // picks a random gate id 
    GATE_ID=$RANDOM
    let "GATE_ID %= $GATE_COUNT"
    //fires event to development server
    curl --insecure -v -X POST https://dev.baam.nexenio.com/api/logs 
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
        -H "Authorization: Basic zdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwi" 
        -d '{"gateId":"'"$GATE_ID"'", "wasSuccessful": "true", "accessType": "ENTRY", "loglevel": "DEBUG", "deviceId":"'"$DEVICE_ID_WHICH_ACCESSED"'"}'
}
// make 100 calls to our backend
for ((i=0;i<100;i++));
do
    // sleep time determines the interval at which the events are sent
    sleep $SLEEP_TIME;
    // the usage of the ampersand makes this call asynchronous
    createGateEventLog &
done
\end{lstlisting}

The script will result in multiple notifications from the backend about gate events. In the frontend, we will then look at the delay time between the emission of these notifications and the completion of certain methods. This measurement delivers a good metric for evaluating the real-time data visualization of our application because we can determine the time gap between the actual gate event and the associated display in our floorplan.

To measure the delay time the frontend client is looking at the timestamp of the event object that is received through the notification from the backend and then creates a new timestamp once the desired function has been successfully terminated. By looking at the difference between the timestamps we can then calculate the delay time. The frontend client will keep track of all the 100 single delay measurements and calculate the average. 

We set up two points of measurement in the frontend. The first measures the delay time for the completion of the method that re-colorizes the room where the event happened and thereby updates the visual occupancy state of the room. The second is set up in the Activity Monitor and measures the delay for the completion of adding a new log message to the table.
The results of this can be seen in Table~\ref{table:benchmark:transmissiondelay}.

\end{tabular}
    \caption{Delay times between backend and frontend}
    \label{table:benchmark:transmissiondelay}
\end{table}

As we can see, our application updates the color of the room quite fast in the low frequency and medium frequency simulations with a delay time of just 166ms at low frequency and 138ms at medium frequency.
Also, the addition of the log message happens fast with a delay time of 219ms at low frequency and 190ms at medium frequency.
But at a high frequency, we can see a drop in performance. Although the updating of the room color still happens quite fast with an average delay time of 343ms, the addition of the log message happens here with a delay time of 14.5 seconds. 

This could be because in the high-frequency simulation the script from Listing~\ref{listing:realtimeEvaluationScript} is sending a request to our backend every 0.1 seconds (600 entries per minute), but the average completion time for the create event log POST request is 0.3 seconds. This means that our backend has to handle multiple POST requests at the same time, which could be critical if the setup of our backend server is not capable of handling this case properly. But also the high load of work that has to happen almost simultaneously in the frontend could be the cause of the performance drop. 

But although there are performance issues at high frequency, the average building will likely not have that many entries per minute, which makes our floorplan performant in displaying data in real-time for the average use case. We can also conclude that the update process of the heatmap each time an event happens is fast and reliable. Moreover, we can conclude that the display of alarm events on the map and in the Activity Monitor is also fast and thereby helps the facility management to quickly react to security threats.

\subsection{Logging Server Response Time}

To measure how good the event logging in our system works, we will look at the response time from the search request we've seen in Listing~\ref{listing:elasticsearchRequest}
at different amounts of logs in our log database. With this measurement, we can see how performant searching through gate logs is in small and large environments. 

We measured the response time by executing a bash script which executes a cURL\footnote{https://curl.haxx.se/} request 100 times and calculates the average response time. 
The result of this measurement can be seen in Table~\ref{table:elasticResponseTimes}.
 
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|llll}
\textbf{Amount of logs}                                                      & \textbf{1000} & \textbf{10000} & \textbf{100000} & \textbf{1000000} \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Average response time\\ (in seconds)\end{tabular} & 0.33               & 0.33           & 0.31            & 0.34             \\ 
\end{tabular}
    \caption{Elasticsearch server response times}
    \label{table:elasticResponseTimes}
\end{table}

We see that while the amount of logs is growing exponentially the average response time stays constant. Even for 1 million logs we still have the same response time as for 1000 logs, which makes the display of the heatmap on the floorplan fast, even for a large set of data. The usage of the Elasticsearch server with its fast searching mechanism build inside makes this performance possible.

\subsection{Interactive Floorplan}

Since there is no clear metric for evaluating interactivity we will look at the performance of the floorplan in click, drag and scroll events at different amounts of gate markers (10, 100 and 1000 markers in the same view frame) on the plan. We utilize the Google Chrome Performance tab for measuring the performance for different events. The tests are done on a MacbookPro with an Intel Iris Graphics 6100 graphics card and a 2,7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor on Google Chrome (Version 75.0.3770.142). The results can be seen in Table~\ref{table:performanceWebApplication}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Amount of gate markers}                                                                                 & \textbf{10} & \textbf{100} & \textbf{1000} \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Frames per second at drag event\\ (changing location in floorplan)\end{tabular}         & 49          & 19           & 2             \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Frames per second at scroll event \\ (changing zoom level of floorplan)\end{tabular} & 70          & 66           & 2             \\ \hline
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Execution time in milliseconds \\ of click event handler\end{tabular}                & 58          & 56           & 56            \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
    \caption{Web application performance for different events}
    \label{table:performanceWebApplication}
\end{table}

The performance of handling the click events stays constant in our tests no matter the number of gate markers on the map. But we can see that the rendering performance of the floorplan if the user drags or scrolls is dependant on the number of gate markers. At an amount of 1000 gate markers in the view frame the frames per second at dragging or scrolling drop to 2 frames per second. This makes the interactive floorplan unresponsive and therefore uncomfortable to use at large amounts of gate markers. Better handling of the map rendering is necessary here.

\subsection{Data Privacy}
\label{Data Privacy}

Our implementation protects data privacy by using a local logging server, which is storing and analyzing gate event data in an internal database. The data is thereby not shared with any third parties. Furthermore, our API endpoint for retrieving gate event data is guarded by Keycloak\footnote{https://www.keycloak.org/}, an open-source access management solution. This protects the gate event data from unauthorized access. Also, the Socket.IO server is only sending data to users that are authenticated by verifying that the Socket.IO client is requesting data with a valid Keycloak access token. Additionally, we only share this data with trustworthy admin personnel and no other users by using separated communication channels for users and admins.

Moreover, the data that is visible in the frontend about the user that enters or exits a gate is coming from user data that is stored in our system. The gates are only sending us the id of the device, which is then mapped to the stored user data. Therefore we don't reveal any further information about the device or any sensitive data about the owner that could be stored on that device.
